# My First dApp

This repository contains the code for my first decentralized application (dApp), which is a simple interface for interacting with an Ethereum smart contract to set or get a mood.

I took a help of a [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqxAWLi6UMA). It helped me made this. 

## Overview

This dApp serves as an introduction to building decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. The application allows users to set or retrieve a mood by interacting with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum network. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend smart contract is written in Solidity.

### Features

- **Set Mood**: Users can set their current mood by entering a mood text in the input field and clicking the "Set Mood" button.
- **Get Mood**: Users can retrieve the previously set mood by clicking the "Get Mood" button, which fetches the mood from the smart contract and displays it on the console.
